# Unhooked

## Description

Unhooked is an APP that is being designed to help people be more productive by addicting them to being productive. 
It follows the principles explained in the book [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked).

This is a way the app might work:
1. Trigger - The external trigger will be based on notification.
2. Action - These have to be streamlined and will be adding objectives, daily tasks, challenges and mark them as done.
3. Variable Reward - This can be done by getting the user to go get quick challenges that push the user to do his goals.
4. Investment - This will be achieved by having a streak and maybe getting a social aspect to it.

The login and storing of the information will be stored using Firebase.
