# Unhooked

## Description

Unhooked is an APP that is being designed to help people be more productive by addicting them to being productive. 
It follows the principles explained in the book [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked).

This is a way the app might work:

1. Trigger
External Trigger: Start by setting up notifications or reminders to nudge users to engage with their goals. For example:
Daily reminders to code or go to the gym at preferred times.
Alerts when users complete milestones, like a streak of consecutive days or hitting a new coding skill.
Internal Trigger: As users build a habit, the app could encourage them to link positive feelings with their activities.
Encouragements like “Remember how good you felt after your last workout?” could be added to notifications.
Include gentle reminders of their long-term goals to reinforce intrinsic motivation.
2. Action
Make it easy for users to complete or record small tasks toward their goal:
Coding Habit: Offer a “Quick Coding Challenge” or “Practice Log” that users can complete in 5-10 minutes. Partner with coding platforms or include simple exercises directly in the app.
Gym Habit: Enable users to track a simple workout or log their gym attendance with one tap, removing any barriers.
Lowering the entry barrier is key to maintaining action consistency; users are more likely to keep coming back if they feel their goals are achievable without a big time commitment.
3. Variable Reward
For Coding: Incorporate gamified rewards that vary, such as:
Randomized coding challenges that are new each day.
Badges or “level-ups” for completing tasks, such as daily streaks, problem-solving speed, or reaching new skill levels.
For Gym: Provide unpredictable, motivating rewards that keep workouts interesting:
Daily “Mystery Rewards” for gym attendance, like unlocking workout tips, fitness articles, or motivational quotes.
Rewards could also include points for completing a workout, which can unlock achievements, encouraging continued use.
4. Investment
Coding Investment: Encourage users to record progress and invest effort in their learning journey.
Track completed exercises, favorite coding topics, or “favorite problems” to revisit.
Allow users to build a “project portfolio” over time within the app.
Gym Investment: Enable users to log workouts and track physical improvements, such as weight lifted, reps, or running distance over time.
Offer an option to add notes on how they felt after a workout to create a sense of personal achievement.
As users log workouts, they build a visual representation of their fitness journey, which makes it harder to abandon.
Additional Tips to Strengthen Engagement
Personalization: Make the app adaptable to users' goals. For example, they can choose specific coding languages or types of exercises they want to focus on. Personalized goals make users feel the app is tailored to them.

Community Element: Add a social feature where users can connect, share progress, or even engage in friendly challenges. Social accountability is a powerful motivator, especially for building habits like going to the gym or coding.

Reflection & Review: Add a weekly or monthly summary that shows users their progress, highlights milestones, and celebrates wins. This keeps users aware of their growth and reaffirms their commitment to these positive habits.
